# Iomonitor
## A multi-monitor tool to limit the range of mouse movement

I do this because when you have multiple monitors and you want to quickly move the cursor to one side of the screen between the two monitors, it becomes very challenging because your cursor crosses over the other monitor. For example, quickly grabbing a window and sliding it to the edge of the screen, making it occupy half of the screen, multiple displays will make it difficult.

That's why I'm doing this.

> Due to the limitations of the SDK on the Windows platform, the current implementation is not perfect. Further consideration may be given to refactoring using alternative implementation methods.
